# ft-menus

Powerful micro framework for implementing navigation and all kind of menus into your existing FileMaker app.

## What does 'FT' stand for?

All our **FileMaker**-based projects and products are prefixed with an **F** and the **T** is for **tools**, **technology**, **tipps&tricks**, **techniques** or open **templates** for the community. These files are basically examples and demonstrations where you can copy stuff from and include it your individual apps and solutions.
